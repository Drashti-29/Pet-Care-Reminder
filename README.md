# Pet Care Reminder App

## Overview
The Pet Care Reminder App assists pet owners in managing their pets' care routines by providing reminders for activities like feeding, grooming, vet appointments, and medication. The app allows users to add pet details, set reminders, and view reminders. It also includes sound effects that play based on the selected pet type and button interactions.

## Features
- **Add Pet Details**: Users can input details about their pets, including name, type, breed, age, weight, height, color, and sex.
- **Set Reminders**: Users can create reminders for pet care activities such as feeding, grooming, cleaning, vet visits, and medication.
- **View Reminders**: Users can view and manage their set reminders.
- **Sound Features**: The app plays specific sounds related to the selected pet type and button interactions.

## Sound Activation Note
If the sound does not play, please click anywhere on the window to activate the DOM (Document Object Model) for audio playback. This action is often required by browsers to enable audio features.

## Sound Effects
The app includes sound effects for different pet types and button interactions:

### Pet Type Sounds
- **Dog**: Plays a dog barking sound.
- **Cat**: Plays a cat meowing sound.
- **Bird**: Plays a bird chirping sound.
- **Rabbit**: Plays a rabbit squeaking sound.
- **Hamster**: Plays a hamster squeaking sound.
- **Fish**: Plays a water bubbling sound.

### Button Sounds

- **Schedule Button**: Plays a scheduling sound effect when clicked.

Audio files for each pet type and button interaction are included, and the corresponding sound is played based on the userâ€™s actions.
